### 10/19/24:
* Installed Godot
* Installed .net SDK
* skimmed through [C# documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php)
    * It seems like it's very similar to Java with some slight differences like `Console.WriteLine()` instead of `System.out.println()` or `namespace` instead of `package`
    * Both Java and C# have the same OOP concepts
